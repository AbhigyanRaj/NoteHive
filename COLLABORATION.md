# Real-Time Collaboration Features

## Overview
NoteHive now supports real-time collaboration, allowing multiple users to simultaneously edit notes with live updates, cursor tracking, typing indicators, and user presence awareness.

## Features Implemented

### Backend (Socket.io Server)
- **WebSocket Server**: Integrated Socket.io with Express server on port 5001
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication for socket connections
- **Room Management**: Note-specific rooms for isolated collaboration
- **Real-time Updates**: Broadcast note changes to all collaborators
- **User Presence**: Track active users in each note
- **Cursor Tracking**: Live cursor position sharing
- **Typing Indicators**: Real-time typing status updates
- **Auto Cleanup**: Periodic cleanup of stale data

### Frontend (React + Socket.io Client)
- **Collaboration Service**: Centralized service for real-time communication
- **Auto-connect**: Automatic connection on user login
- **Note Editor Integration**: Real-time updates in note editor
- **Visual Indicators**: 
  - Connection status (Connected/Offline)
  - Active collaborators count
  - Typing indicators with animated dots
  - Collaborator avatars
- **Event Handling**: Comprehensive event system for all collaboration features

## How It Works

### Connection Flow
1. User logs in → AuthContext automatically connects to collaboration service
2. User opens note → Joins note-specific room
3. Real-time events are exchanged between all users in the room
4. User closes note → Leaves room and cleans up

### Real-time Events
- `join-note`: User joins a note room
- `note-update`: Note content/title changes
- `cursor-update`: Cursor position changes
- `typing-start/stop`: Typing indicators
- `user-joined/left`: User presence updates

### Visual Feedback
- **Connection Status**: Green dot (connected) / Gray dot (offline)
- **Collaborators**: Shows count and avatars of active users
- **Typing Indicators**: Animated dots with user names
- **Real-time Updates**: Instant content synchronization

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Structure
```
backend/src/sockets/collaboration.js - Main collaboration logic
backend/src/index.js - Socket.io server setup
```

### Frontend Structure
```
frontend/src/services/collaborationService.ts - Client service
frontend/src/context/AuthContext.tsx - Auto-connection
frontend/src/components/NoteEditor.tsx - UI integration
```

### Key Technologies
- **Socket.io**: Real-time bidirectional communication
- **JWT**: Secure authentication for socket connections
- **React Context**: State management for collaboration data
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe event handling

## Usage

### For Users
1. **Login** to your account
2. **Open any note** to start editing
3. **Share the note** with other users
4. **See real-time updates** as others edit
5. **View typing indicators** when others are typing
6. **See collaborator avatars** in the footer

### For Developers
1. **Backend**: Collaboration events are handled in `src/sockets/collaboration.js`
2. **Frontend**: Use `collaborationService` to interact with real-time features
3. **Events**: All events are typed and documented in the service
4. **Testing**: Multiple browser tabs can simulate different users

## Security
- JWT token validation for all socket connections
- User access verification for each note
- Room isolation prevents cross-note data leakage
- Automatic cleanup of stale connections

## Performance
- Efficient event broadcasting using Socket.io rooms
- Periodic cleanup of inactive cursors and typing indicators
- Optimized for multiple concurrent users per note
- Graceful handling of connection drops and reconnections

## Future Enhancements
- Conflict resolution for simultaneous edits
- Version history with collaboration tracking
- Advanced cursor visualization
- Voice/video chat integration
- Collaborative commenting system
