# Testing Real-Time Collaboration

## Test Scenario: Cross-User Note Sharing

### What We've Implemented:
1. **Shared Notes**: Notes are now accessible to all users (removed user-specific filtering)
2. **Real-time Broadcasting**: 
   - Note creation broadcasts to all connected users
   - Note deletion broadcasts to all connected users
   - Note updates broadcast to all connected users
3. **Dashboard Integration**: Dashboard listens for real-time events and updates UI

### How to Test:

#### Setup:
1. Backend server running on port 5001 âœ…
2. Frontend accessible via browser preview âœ…

#### Test Steps:
1. **Open two browser tabs/windows**
2. **Login with different accounts in each tab** (or same account)
3. **Create a note in Tab 1**
   - Should appear immediately in Tab 2 without refresh
4. **Edit the note in Tab 2**
   - Changes should appear in Tab 1 in real-time
5. **Delete the note in Tab 1**
   - Should disappear from Tab 2 immediately

#### Expected Behavior:
- âœ… All users see all notes (no user-specific filtering)
- âœ… New notes appear instantly across all clients
- âœ… Note edits sync in real-time
- âœ… Note deletions remove from all clients immediately
- âœ… Visual indicators show collaboration status

#### Key Changes Made:
1. **Backend Model**: Changed from `userId` to `createdBy` and `lastEditedBy`
2. **API Routes**: Removed user filtering, added broadcasting
3. **Socket Events**: Added global note events (`note-created`, `note-deleted`)
4. **Frontend**: Dashboard listens for real-time note events

### Current Status:
- Backend: âœ… Running and ready
- Frontend: âœ… Updated with real-time listeners
- Real-time Events: âœ… Implemented
- Cross-user Sharing: âœ… Enabled

**Ready for testing!** ðŸš€
